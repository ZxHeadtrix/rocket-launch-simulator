# Rocket Launch Simulator (2D, Python)

Hey! This is my little **2D Rocket Launch Simulator** built in Python. ðŸš€  

It simulates a rocket taking off, showing how **thrust, drag, gravity, and fuel** affect its flight. I built this to learn physics and coding while having some fun with rockets!

---

## Features
- Adjustable parameters: mass, fuel, thrust, drag coefficient, and more.  
- Realistic physics: gravity changes with altitude and air density decreases exponentially.  
- Simple **HUD** shows time, altitude, velocity, and remaining fuel.  
- Press **G** to see graphs of altitude vs time and velocity vs time.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.  
2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the simulator:

```bash
python rocket_sim.py
```
